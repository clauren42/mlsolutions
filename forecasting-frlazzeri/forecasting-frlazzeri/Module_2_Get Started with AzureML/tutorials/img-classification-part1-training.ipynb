You'll use the training and deployment workflow for Azure Machine Learning service (preview) in a Python Jupyter notebook.  You can then use the notebook as a template to train your own machine learning model with your own data. This tutorial is **part one of a two-part tutorial series**.  \n\nThis tutorial trains a simple logistic regression using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) with Azure Machine Learning.  MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing a number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit a given image represents. \n\nLearn how to:\n\n> * Set up your development environment\n> * Access and examine the data\n> * Train a simple logistic regression model locally using the popular scikit-learn machine learning library \n> * Train multiple models on a remote cluster\n> * Review training results, find and register the best model\n\nYou'll learn how to select a model and deploy it in [part two of this tutorial](deploy-models.ipynb) later. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\nUse [these instructions](https://aka.ms/aml-how-to-configure-environment) to:  \n* Create a workspace and its configuration file (**config.json**)  \n* Save your **config.json** to the same folder as this notebook"

But for subsequent runs, as long as the script dependencies don't change, the same image is reused and hence the container start up time is much faster.\n\nHere is what's happening while you wait:\n\n- **Image creation**: A Docker image is created matching the Python environment specified by the estimator. The image is uploaded to the workspace. Image creation and uploading takes **about 5 minutes**. \n\n  This stage happens once for each Python environment since the container is cached for subsequent runs.  During image creation, logs are streamed to the run history. You can monitor the image creation progress using these logs.\n\n- **Scaling**: If the remote cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than currently available, additional nodes are added automatically. Scaling typically takes **about 5 minutes.**\n\n- **Running**: In this stage, the necessary scripts and files are sent to the compute target, then data stores are mounted/copied, then the entry_script is run. While the job is running, stdout and the ./logs directory are streamed to the run history. You can monitor the run's progress using these logs.\n\n- **Post-Processing**: The ./outputs directory of the run is copied over to the run history in your workspace so you can access these results.\n\n\nYou can check the progress of a running job in multiple ways.
