# Overview

The automation of detecting anomalous events in videos is a challenging problem that currently attracts a lot of attention by researchers, but also has broad applications across industry verticals.  

The approach involves training deep neural networks to develop an in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules in the observed scenes. The model effectively learns to predict future frames in the video. By calculating the error in this prediction, it is then possible to detect if something unusual, an anomalous event, occurred, if there is a large prediction error.  

The approach can be used both in a supervised and unsupervised fashion, thus enabling the detection of pre-defined anomalies, but also of anomalous events that have never occurred in the past.

# Learning Goals

You will learn:
1. How to adapt an existing neural network architecture to your use-case.
1. How to prepare video data for deep learning. 
1. How to perform hyperparameter tuning with [HyperDrive](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/experimentation-using-azure-machine-learning/) to improve the performance of you model.
1. How to deploy a deep neural network as a webservice for video processing. 
1. How to post-process the output of a Keras model for secondary tasks (here, anomaly detection)
2. How to define a build pipeline for DevOps.


# Pre-requisites

## Skills

1. Some familiarity with concepts and frameworks for neural networks:
	- Framework: [Keras](https://keras.io/)
	- Concepts: [convolutional](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/), [recurrent](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/), and [pooling](https://keras.io/layers/pooling/) layers.
2. Knowledge of basic data science and machine learning concepts. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNV9EqwXCpw) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBDSBInvz08) you'll find short introductory material.
3. Moderate skills in coding with Python and machine learning using Python. A good place to start is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rf4fZDQ0yw&list=PLjgj6kdf_snaw8QnlhK5f3DzFDFKDU5f4).

## Software Dependencies

- Various python modules. We recommend working with a conda environement (see `environment.yml`) - [Documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
- VS code [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- X2Go [https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php)

We found that a useful development environment is to have a VM with a GPU and connect to it using X2Go.

## Hardware Dependencies

A computer with a GPU, Standard NC6 sufficient, faster learning with NC6_v2/3 or ND6. [compare VM sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu)

## Dataset

[UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.htm)

## Agenda

### Getting Started

1. [Data Preparation](./docs/data_prep_w_pillow.md)
2. [Model Development](./docs/model_development.md)
3. [Hyperparameter Tuning](./docs/hyperparameter_tuning.md)
4. [Anomaly Detection](./docs/anomaly_detection.md)
5. [Deployment](./docs/deployment.md)

### Advanced Topics (coming soon)

1. Transfer learning - (How to quickly train the model on different source of video)
1. DevOps - See this [blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/breaking-the-wall-between-data-scientists-and-app-developers-with-azure-devops/)
