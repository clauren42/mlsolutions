The concepts you'll learn about are workspace, experiment and run.\n\n**Run** is a an execution of Python code that does a machine learning task, such as training a model. Within a run you can log metrics and upload results to Azure cloud, to keep track of your experimentation. \n \nIn this example, the run is a simple notebook cell, but in subsequent tutorials you can learn how to submit different kinds of runs - hyperparameter tuning, automated machine learning, distributed training - to scalable cloud compute.\n \n**Experiment** is a collection of related runs. For example, if you train different models to solve the same problem, you can group the training runs under the same experiment, and later compare their results.\n \n**Workspace** is an Azure resource that contains your experiments, models, deployments and cloud compute resources.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we use a simple example of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate pi. You first connect to your workspace, create an experiment that will contains the different simulation runs, and then launch a run and log the progress on Monte Carlo simulation."
