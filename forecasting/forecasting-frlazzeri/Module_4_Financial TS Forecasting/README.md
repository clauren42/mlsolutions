## Data
For stock market predictions use case, we will be using data from Alpha Vantage (you will first need an API key, which you can obtain for free here) and from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs). And for the notebook named "RNN_LSTM_GRU.ipynb", we will be using daily OHLC data for the stock of “RELIANCE” trading on National Stock Exchange for the time period from 1st January 1996 to 30 Sep 2018.
